# Week 4 Foreseen objectives

## Setting capture the flag problems
- First half of the week: taking in always online CTFs.
- Second half of the week: setting up CTF problems

# Week 4 Objectives Achieved

## Learn about various disciplines related to CTF problems

### Forensics
- Analysing packet capture dumps using _Wireshark_.
- Extracting plaintext passwords (or `base64` encoded) from `pcap` file.
- Learning about `User-Agent` strings. Extracting browser info from `pcap` file.

### Cryptography
- Basics of how cryptography works. Symmetric key cryptograhy, public key cryptography and logging in using public keys through`SSH`.
- Basic symmetric key cryptography algorithms: Substitution algorithms such as _Caesar cipher_, _Vigen√®re cipher_,  _monoalphabetic substitution cipher_.
- Learn in detail about _Base64_ encryption. Learn basic details about _RSA_ and _AES_ encryption.
- Learn about _Hash Functions_ (MD5).
- Cracking common hashes using various web-services.

### Web Exploitation
- Executing _javascript_ in `chrome developer console` to exploit.
- _SQL Injection_: 
    - Craking login form by submitting SQL through login form.

### Miscellaneous
- Using _netcat_ (`nc`) command to connect to arbitrary machine at an arbitrary port.
- Using basic linux commands such as `find` and `grep`.
